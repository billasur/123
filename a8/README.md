## Overview
- The prime objective of this lab is to understand how CRUD (create read update delete) operations can be achieved using ReactJs.
- The second important objective of this lab is to understand the use of components.
- Finally, this exercise will also focus on props and states (states using class component).
- You can consider this as a lab/project which covers everything that we have learned by now.


## Introduction:
- For this exercise, the aim is just to see how simple CRUD operations can be performed. If you are not familiar with what CRUD is or you need some revision -- you can visit this link, to have better understanding.

- To-do-list is one of the simplest idea, where CRUD can be easily observed. For eg:

- If I want to add new action item for a particular day --> I can create an item and add to my to-do-list.
- Once the action item is created then I can read that action item -> anytime I open my to-do-list application.
- I can even update the action item - if needed. For eg: if I wanted to write Buy Mac, but by mistake I wrote Buy Windows, then I should be able to update this current action item.
- Once the action item is achieved - then I should be able to delete that particular action item.
- So, with a simple to-do-list app, we can achieve all the CRUD operations.

## Steps to follow:

- The application( React+vite) is setup for you.
- Follow each segment given below - in order to get an idea of how the app should work. Note: This lab is not focussing much on the styling part -- but feel free to add styles to your project. If you want - you can even mimic the design as shown below

## Update

For the update functionality - you can even try creating a button for it. (Upon clicking the button, you should be able to edit the item.)

## Delete
