# React Like Buttons Project

## Project Overview

This project contains two React components: `LikePost` and `LikeImage`. Each component has a button that allows users to "like" an item (a post or an image). The task is to implement the logic for incrementing the like counters and write tests to ensure the components behave correctly.

## Learning Goals

1. **React State Management**:
   - Understand how to use the `useState` hook to manage local state in a component.
   - Learn how to update the state and trigger a re-render in response to user interactions.

2. **Component Design**:
   - Build reusable, isolated components that manage their own state and behavior.

3. **Event Handling**:
   - Learn how to handle button clicks and update UI elements dynamically.


## Tasks

### Task 1: Implement the `LikeImage` Component

**Goal**: Implement a button that increments a like counter for an image each time it's clicked.

**Steps**:
- Define a state to keep track of the like counter.
- Implement a function that increments the like counter when the button is clicked.
- Display the current like counter inside the button.

### Task 2: Implement the `LikePost` Component

**Goal**: Implement a button that increments a like counter for a post each time it's clicked.

**Steps**:
- Define a state to keep track of the like counter.
- Implement a function that increments the like counter when the button is clicked.
- Display the current like counter inside the button.
