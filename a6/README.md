Overview:
You are tasked with building a simple note-keeping application using React. The application will allow users to type notes into a text area on the left side of the screen, and the typed text should immediately be reflected on the right side of the screen. This assignment will help you practice working with React components, state management, and event handling.

Requirements:
 Heading
 Add a Heading 'Kalvium Note Keeping App' The output should have 'ProNote' title
Text Input:
Implement a text input area where users can type their notes.
The text input should be a textarea element.

Real-Time Reflection:
Whatever the user types in the textarea should be displayed in real-time in a separate output area on the right side of the screen.
This output should be updated dynamically as the user types.

Component Structure:
You will need to complete the code in App.jsx.
Manage the text input's value using the component's state.
Use the onChange event handler to update the state whenever the user types something in the textarea.

Styling:
Ensure the application is styled appropriately.
The header should contain the title "Kalvium Note Keeping App".
