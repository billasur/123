Overview:-
A quiz application is already built for you.
This is the continuation of the previous assignment ` Project Builder Quiz App Stage 1`




Introduction
We will work on the Quiz component today. We will render the data from the json file rather than keeping it static and we will complete the event handlers for previous, next and quit.
So let's get started! Check below to see the overall output: You will be trying to replicate this.

 An array of 15 questions is already provided to you, in this repository inside src/components/quizQuestion.json file.



PROGRESSION 2 | JUMP TO NEXT
Complete the event handler for next button such that you should dynamically go to the next question in the array.

[Optional Challenge] PROGRESSION 3 | I WANT TO QUIT
When the user clicks the quit button, a pop-up should come stating -> Are you sure you want to quit ?


Happy Coding Kalvium ❤️!
