Overview:-
A quiz application is already built for you.
In this exercise, the goal is to learn building a complete quiz app on a stage by stage basis:

props and state,
how to work with event handlers.
work with json object.



Introduction
We will work on the Quiz component today. We will render the data from the json file rather than keeping it static and we will complete the event handlers for previous, next and quit.
So let's get started! Check below to see the overall output: You will be trying to replicate this.

 An array of 15 questions is already provided to you, in this repository inside src/components/quizQuestion.json file.

Complete the event handler for previous button such that you should dynamically go back to the previous question in the array.
