 Learning Goals
In this exercise, the goal is to understand and experiment around JSX - using both class and functional components.
Introduction
The task is to create a webpage which looks like the image below:

 Few lines of code is already written for you -- in the following files:

App.jsx : In this file, you need to complete the task by using functional component. In this file, imageData is a function which stores the an array of objects -> which contains two fields: id and image. Image is added as Image Links
AppClass.jsx:  Similar to 1st case, imageData is defined for you, you just need to complete the class component AppClass - and get an output as shown in the above image.

App.jsx - we are rendering as Functional component, AppClass.jsx we are rendering a class Component.

Once you are able to display the images on the browser, then you can style it in App.css file. If you observe, in both the files, App.css is the only style sheet which is being imported, so any styles added to this file, will be reflected for both the cases.

Run `npm run dev` to visualise output
Run `npm run test:serve` to visualise Test Cases
